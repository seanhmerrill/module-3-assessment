        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am very interested in making anyone's day easier or more convenient. 
            Building frameworks that help people out is something that I thoroughly enjoy.
            I also really enjoy being active. I love playing volleyball and lifting weights.
        </p>
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>
            My goal in my career is to be able to work in a field that I am not only interested in, 
            but passionate about. I'd love to be able to work my way up to being a full-stack web developer.
            I love working on projects and having full jurisdiction over it. I love taking full responsibility regardless,
            but I feel like my skill set is best utilized when I have complete control.
        </p>
